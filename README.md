## âœ¨ Enhanced Version

A performant and flexible standalone "third-eye" targeting resource, now featuring **enhanced glassmorphism design**, **smooth animations**, and **advanced features**.

ox_target is the successor to qtarget, which was a mostly-compatible fork of bt-target.
To improve many design flaws, ox_target has been written from scratch and drops support for bt-target/qtarget standards, though partial compatibility is being implemented where possible.
